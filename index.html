<p>&ldquo;Sonya worked to find us exactly what we wanted.  She showed us any house we wanted to see.  There were several! Rain or shine or 12 inches of snow, Sonya is extremely professional and experienced.  She made us feel comfortable as if we were friends and not just clients.  Not only did Sonya find us exactly what we were looking for, she also sold our home.  If any of my friends or family decide to purchase a home, cabin or land I will be sure they contact Sonya.  I have dealt with other agents in the past; Sonya did the best job by far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for all your time and expertise during our vacation home search.  We knew it wouldn't be easy finding something that we could both agree on.  You were able to take our vague ideas of what we wanted and help transform them into reality.  I know a few times we frustrated you by changing our minds at the last minute. Still, you saw in our faces the relaxation that occurred when we first toured the cabin.  You helped guide us through a difficult inspection and closing.  Thank you for remaining positive and for pushing us forward.  The cabin has been a dream come true.  We've only spent one weekend up there but already we are more relaxed and I feel we will become closer as a family as we spend more weekends together.  Thank you again for your time and patience.  You've been wonderful to work with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan and I would like to take a moment now that all the dust has settled and thank you!  We have bought and sold a few houses in the past and dealt with some great people.  This sale was definitely not the easiest one we or your have been involved in.  The boarder and differences in real estate and law practices gave us some unique challenges.  However, you never complained, were always accommodating, patient, quick to respond and extremely professional.  Even with all the challenges you helped us have a great experience for our first vacation home.  We hope to see you when we are in the area....it is an open invitation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to thank you for all your help with purchasing our new home. We were very worried about the whole process, since we are disabled and living in Florida.

You have gone above and beyond in so many ways by helping us through the process of finding a cottage that fit our specific desires, that in my mind, you are "Realtor of the Year".  Thank you for your continued patience, your kindness and warmth, your professionalism and down to earth style, your immense knowledge of the area, your tireless search for answers to our questions (or honestly, my husbands:), and most importantly, just continuing to work with us.  It has been an absolute pleasure to have had you as our Realtor and the best Realtor experience we have ever had.  Thank you!

<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>&ldquo;When I have worked with people on different projects over my own 43 year career I have found that the one key element to success is the ability to communicate and keep everyone in the loop.  I knew about you and what you were able to do because you mailed postcards to my primary residence in Ohio for years reporting what you had listed and what you sold.  I was naturally drawn to your agency because of that communication.  Then, after I engaged your services, you provided me information that made it clear what my property on Wixom Lake was really worth and how much I should expect it to bring from the sale.  The short time it was on the market you kept me informed about everything that was happening. And, in the end, the resulting sale profited much more than I, at first, thought it would be.  Knowing what a seller needs to know and communicating that information on a regular basis makes the whole experience less difficult for people like me who sell property only once in awhile.&rdquo;</p>
